# Sales-and-Finance-Report-for-Atliq-Hardwares

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! ðŸš€

I've just completed an in-depth Sales and Finance report for AtliQ Hardwares using Excel. This project involved:
- Creating dynamic **pivot tables** to summarize sales data
- Leveraging **Power Pivot** for advanced data modeling
- Utilizing **Power Query** to clean and transform data
- Writing complex **DAX formulas** for insightful metrics and KPIs

This comprehensive report includes:
- Sales performance analysis by region, customer, and product
- Performance vs. target comparisons
- Detailed profit and loss statements by market
- Gross margin analysis by quarter

I'm thrilled with the insights derived from this project and the opportunity to demonstrate my proficiency in these advanced Excel features.
