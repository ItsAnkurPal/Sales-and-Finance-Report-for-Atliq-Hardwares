I've just completed an in-depth Sales and Finance report for AtliQ Hardwares using Excel. This project involved:
- Creating dynamic **pivot tables** to summarize sales data
- Leveraging **Power Pivot** for advanced data modeling
- Utilizing **Power Query** for ETL processes to clean and transform data
- Writing complex **DAX formulas** for insightful metrics and KPIs

This comprehensive report includes:
